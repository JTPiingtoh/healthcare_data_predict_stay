Implementing novel KNN-models from "Effective kâ€‘nearest neighbor models for data
classification enhancement".

This repository contains a PRKNNClassifier python class, which implements a sci-kit learn API complient implentation of the proximal ratio (PR) KNN models described in the paper above. The PRKNNClassifier can be found in test_class.py.

In main.ipynb, I describe how the models work, discuss some of the challanges I encountered while implementing them, and try to replicate some of the results the creators of this model obtained. 

This project is still ongoing, as I look to optimize the performance of the PRKNNClassifier.
